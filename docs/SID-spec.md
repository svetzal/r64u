## Commodore SID File Format Specification

### Introduction &amp; History

Commodore 64 SID music files (with the .sid extension) are a combination of metadata and Commodore 64 machine code that drives the **SID** chip (Sound Interface Device) to produce music. This format was originally introduced by the **PlaySID** software (an early SID music player on Amiga), and later adopted and extended by the High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC) for preserving C64 music. The SID file wraps a C64 program (6502 machine code and data) with a header that describes how to load and play the music [[1]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=The%20High%20Voltage%20SID%20collection,their%20offset%20from%20the%20start) . Over time, the format evolved through **PSID v1** (the original PlaySID format), **PSID v2** (with extended header fields, often called PSID v2NG for “Next Generation” enhancements), and **RSID** (introduced in HVSC v5.1) which marks tunes that require a real C64 environment [[2]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=latest%20libsidplay2%20emulation%20engine%20,which%20allows%20for%20safe%20rejection) [[3]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=RSID%20is%20an%20extension%20of,time%20sample%20playback%2C%20busy) . Later revisions ( **PSID v3** and **v4** ) added support for multiple SID chips in one tune (commonly called 2SID/3SID tunes). Despite these versions, the format remains largely backward compatible, and older players will ignore or reject unsupported features for safety [[3]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=RSID%20is%20an%20extension%20of,time%20sample%20playback%2C%20busy) .

In a SID file, the **header** contains identification, metadata (song name, author, release info), and fields needed to load and play the music. Following the header, the **data section** contains the raw 6510 machine code and sound data. A SID player or emulator uses this information to load the code into memory, initialize the tune, and periodically call the music play routine to generate sound [[1]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=The%20High%20Voltage%20SID%20collection,their%20offset%20from%20the%20start) [[4]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=%2B0A%2016,expected%20to%20double%20as%20init) .

### File Structure Overview

A SID file is structured as follows:

- **Header:** A fixed-layout header (either 0x76 or 0x7C bytes long, depending on version) containing identification, version, load/play addresses, song metadata, and optional flags/extensions. This tells the player how to handle the file.
- **Data Payload:** The remainder of the file is the C64 program data (music driver code and data). If the file’s load address field is zero, the first two bytes of this payload contain the actual 16-bit load address (little-endian) for the data [[5]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B08%20%20%20%20WORD,loadAddress) .

Below is a detailed specification of the header fields and their meanings. Header *offsets* are given in hexadecimal. Unless noted, multi-byte values are stored in **big-endian** (as is standard in SID files) [[6]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20SID%20file%20header%20v1,) .

### Header Fields (PSID v1 Format)

- **0x00: Magic ID** – 4 ASCII bytes, either "PSID" or "RSID". This identifies the file as a SID format. "PSID" is the original **PlaySID** format for C64-compatible tunes, whereas "RSID" (Real SID) denotes a tune that *requires* a full Commodore 64 environment to run properly [[7]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20four%20byte,and%20libsidplay1%20based%20emulators%2C%20too) . RSID files typically contain code that uses C64 features (multiple interrupts, direct hardware access, etc.) that older minimal SID emulators (designed for PSID) cannot handle [[8]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20RSID%20format%20was%20designed,if%20at%20all) . *(In other words, RSID files will be safely rejected by older PlaySID-based players, since they must be run on a cycle-accurate C64 emulator or real hardware.)*
- **0x04: Version (WORD)** – Format version number, stored as a 16-bit big-endian. This can be 0x0001 for the original PSIDv1 or 0x0002 for the extended format. All modern PSID files (v2NG) and RSID files use version 2 here [[9]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B04%20%20%20%20WORD,version) . *(Note: Later HVSC conventions refer to “PSID v3” or “v4” for multi-SID support, but the version field in the file header is still set to 2 in those files for backward compatibility* [*[9]*](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B04%20%20%20%20WORD,version) *. Some documentation may loosely call them v3/v4; effectively they are v2 files with extra fields used.)*
- **0x06: Data Offset (WORD)** – The offset from the file start to where the C64 program data begins. For version 1 this is 0x0076, and for version 2 (and above) it is 0x007C [[10]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B06%20%20%20%20WORD,dataOffset) . This value accounts for the header size. (In a v1 file, offset 0x76 is the first byte of music data; in v2, offset 0x7C is.) The data offset should match the actual header length as defined by the format.
- **0x08: Load Address (WORD)** – The 16-bit memory address where the C64 music data should be loaded. If this field is non-zero, it explicitly specifies the load address. If it is 0x0000, it signals that the *first two bytes of the data payload* contain the little-endian load address (just like a normal C64 PRG file) [[5]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B08%20%20%20%20WORD,loadAddress) . Most SID files use 0 here and include the load address in the data. **RSID requirement:** RSID files *must* set this field to 0 and use the load address from the payload, and that actual load address must be $07E8 or higher [[11]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=magicID%20%3D%20RSID%20version%20%3D,flag%20is%20called%20C64BASIC%20flag) [[5]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B08%20%20%20%20WORD,loadAddress) (to avoid overwriting zero-page or C64 kernel memory on real hardware).
- **0x0A: Init Address (WORD)** – The 16-bit address of the initialization routine for the music. After loading the data into C64 memory, the player will call this address *once* to initialize the tune. By convention, the 6510 **Accumulator (A register)** is used to select the sub-tune number before calling this routine (A=1 for the first song, 2 for second, etc.) [[12]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B0A%20%20%20%20WORD,initAddress) . If this field is 0, it means the init address is the same as the load address (i.e. start execution at the beginning of the loaded data) [[12]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B0A%20%20%20%20WORD,initAddress) . **RSID:** In RSID files, initAddress must not point to a ROM area ($A000–$BFFF or $D000–$FFFF) or be below $07E8, because the code should run in a standard C64 RAM environment [[12]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B0A%20%20%20%20WORD,initAddress) . Additionally, if the file has the “BASIC flag” (see **flags** below) set for RSID, then initAddress is expected to be 0 [[13]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=Since%20RSID%20files%20do%20not,time%2C%20initAddress%20must%20be%200) (the BASIC program in the data will handle initialization instead).
- **0x0C: Play Address (WORD)** – The 16-bit address of the routine that generates music frames. The player will call this address repeatedly (typically at 50Hz for PAL or 60Hz for NTSC, or as determined by the timing mode) to produce continuous sound [[14]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=%2B0C%2016,service%20handler%20itself%20during%20init) . In many SID tunes, this is the address of an interrupt handler or a timing loop that updates the SID registers each frame. If this field is 0, it indicates that the music code installs its *own* interrupt handler during the init routine [[15]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20start%20address%20of%20the,be%20true%20for%20RSID%20files) . In other words, the player should not manually call a play routine in that case – the tune will drive itself via C64 interrupts. **RSID:** RSID files always set playAddress to 0 [[11]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=magicID%20%3D%20RSID%20version%20%3D,flag%20is%20called%20C64BASIC%20flag) [[15]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20start%20address%20of%20the,be%20true%20for%20RSID%20files) , requiring the tune to set up its own IRQ. (This is because RSID tunes are meant to run as if they were running on a real C64 where the program handles the timing.)
- **0x0E: Number of Songs (WORD)** – The number of sub-tunes or songs contained in the file (at least 1, maximum 256) [[16]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B0E%20%20%20%20WORD,songs) . Many SID files contain a single track, but some (particularly game music rips) have multiple songs or sound effects in one file. The init routine uses the A register to select which song to start, in the range 1 to this number.
- **0x10: Start Song (WORD)** – The default song number to play (1-indexed) [[17]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B10%20%20%20%20WORD,startSong) . Typically this is 1, meaning the first tune is the default. It can be set to another sub-tune if the file’s creator wanted a different default (for example, if the file contains both music and sound effects, the default might point to the main music theme). If this field is 0, players will usually treat it as 1 by default. *(In practice, this field is often just 1.)* [[17]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B10%20%20%20%20WORD,startSong)
- **0x12: Speed (LONGWORD, 32-bit)** – A 32-bit flag word that specifies the timing mode for each song in the file [[18]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B12%20%20%20%20LONGWORD,speed) . Each bit in this value corresponds to one song (bit 0 for song 1, bit 1 for song 2, etc., up to 32 songs). If a bit is **0** , the corresponding tune should play at the **vertical blank interrupt rate** (VBI, ~50 Hz for PAL or ~60 Hz for NTSC, depending on the C64’s video system) [[19]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=A%200%20bit%20specifies%20vertical,default%2060Hz) . If a bit is **1** , the tune uses the **CIA timer** interrupt (approx. 60 Hz, stable timing) [[19]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=A%200%20bit%20specifies%20vertical,default%2060Hz) . This allows specification of “fast” songs or those that need CIA-based timing. If there are more than 32 songs, any songs above 32 use the setting of bit 31 (the last bit) [[20]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20a%2032%20bit,for%20all%20higher%20numbered%20tunes) . **RSID:** In RSID files, this entire field is always 0 [[19]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=A%200%20bit%20specifies%20vertical,default%2060Hz) . RSID tunes are expected to configure their own timing and generally run at VBI by default (the player will ignore the speed bits and just use the actual machine’s timing). *Note:* Originally, the PlaySID format used this field slightly differently and did not support NTSC timing properly [[21]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20v2NG%20specific,field) [[22]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,required%20to%20support%20a%20real) . The introduction of the **clock PAL/NTSC flag** in the extended header (see **flags** below) was meant to cleanly handle the video standard, since a PAL tune running on NTSC (or vice-versa) would otherwise play at the wrong speed [[23]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=As%20can%20be%20seen%20from,once%20every%2017045%20cycles%2C%20while) .
- **0x16: Title (32 bytes)** – A text string for the song’s title. This is stored as up to 31 characters of ISO-8859-1 text, terminated by a 0 byte (or padded with 0s to fill 32 bytes) [[24]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B16%20%20%20%20%60%60,copyright) . The last byte (at 0x35) is guaranteed to be 0, so the maximum title length is 31 characters [[24]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B16%20%20%20%20%60%60,copyright) .
- **0x36: Author (32 bytes)** – A text string for the author/composer name, same format (31 chars + terminator) [[24]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B16%20%20%20%20%60%60,copyright) . Often this is the composer or arranger of the music.
- **0x56: Released (32 bytes)** – A text string for release information (31 chars + terminator) [[24]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B16%20%20%20%20%60%60,copyright) . This is sometimes used for the publication or copyright info, the name of the game or production the music is from, and/or the year. In many SID files this field contains a copyright notice or the name of the game/demo.

At this point, the **PSID v1 header ends** (offset 0x56 + 32 bytes = 0x75 is the last byte of the released/copyright string). For **PSID v1** files, the music data begins immediately after, at offset **0x76** [[25]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B76%20%20%20%20) . In PSID v1, no further fields are present. The majority of older SID tunes (ripped before 2000) were in this format, which lacks explicit info about TV system or SID model – these assumptions had to be handled outside the file. Modern SID files usually use the extended header (v2NG) described next.

### Extended Header Fields (PSID v2NG Format)

Version 2 of the SID format extends the header with additional fields (beyond offset 0x75). These fields were introduced to improve compatibility with real hardware and to store more information (such as PAL/NTSC timing and SID chip model) [[26]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,to%20play%20the%20SID%20tune) [[27]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,new%29%20SID%20chip) . The extended fields occupy bytes 0x76 through 0x7B (inclusive), bringing the data offset to **0x7C** for version 2 files [[10]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B06%20%20%20%20WORD,dataOffset) . If the header **version field** is 2, the following fields are present:

- **0x76: Flags (WORD, 16-bit)** – A bit field providing additional information about the SID tune’s format and requirements [[28]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B76%20%20%20%20WORD,flags) [[29]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,RSID) . The bits are defined as:
- **Bit 0: Music player availability. 0** = The file contains its *built-in music player* (i.e. the machine code in the data is self-contained). **1** = The file’s data is in Compute!’s SID *“Musical Player”* (.MUS) format, which means the data is just music data and does **not** include the code to play it [[30]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,music%20player%20must%20be%20merged) . In that case, an external player routine must be merged to run the music. *(This is rarely used in HVSC, as most .sid files include their own player code.)* [[31]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,new%29%20SID)
- **Bit 1: Compatibility flag.** For PSID files, this indicates **PlaySID-specific features** . **0** = C64 compatible, **1** = uses PlaySID quirks (e.g. Digi samples via $D418 volume register that were handled specially on Amiga PlaySID) [[29]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,RSID) . Virtually all modern rips set this to 0 (meaning the tune is composed of real C64 code). **For RSID files, bit 1 is repurposed as the “C64 BASIC flag.”** If set in an RSID, it means the data contains a BASIC program along with the machine code [[13]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=Since%20RSID%20files%20do%20not,time%2C%20initAddress%20must%20be%200) . In such a case, the SID player should actually launch the BASIC interpreter (i.e. simulate a RUN), not just call the init routine, because the BASIC part will call the machine code. (Accordingly, RSID tunes with BASIC set must have initAddress = 0 as mentioned above.)
- **Bits 2–3: Video standard (clock speed).** This specifies the intended **TV system** for correct playback [[32]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20PAL%20and%20NTSC) . Values: 00 = Unknown or not specified, 01 = **PAL** (Euro 50 Hz system), 10 = **NTSC** (USA 60 Hz system), 11 = **PAL &amp; NTSC** (the tune works properly on both) [[32]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20PAL%20and%20NTSC) . This field was introduced because earlier SID format versions had no direct NTSC indication, leading to slight pitch/timing issues for NTSC tunes played on PAL settings and vice-versa [[23]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=As%20can%20be%20seen%20from,once%20every%2017045%20cycles%2C%20while) . A player should adjust the clock or select the appropriate C64 model (which have different CPU clocks) based on this flag for accurate playback.
- **Bits 4–5: SID chip model.** Indicates which type of SID chip the music was composed for [[33]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) . Values: 00 = Unknown, 01 = **6581** (the original SID chip model used in early C64s), 10 = **8580** (the “new SID” used in C64C/128), 11 = **6581 &amp; 8580** (sounds acceptable on both) [[33]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) . This is important because the 6581 and 8580 chips have differences in audio characteristics (filter behavior, combined waveform glitch, and volume levels) [[34]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20MOS6581%20and%20the%20MOS8580,from%20the%20MOS6581%20analog%20filter) . For example, a tune composed on a 6581 might sound too quiet or filtered incorrectly on an 8580 if not configured, and vice versa [[34]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20MOS6581%20and%20the%20MOS8580,from%20the%20MOS6581%20analog%20filter) . The player should select the appropriate SID emulation or hardware chip for playback according to this field.
- **Bits 6–15: Reserved.** These must be 0 in PSID v2 files [[35]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=be%20played%20back%20correctly%2C%20bits,are%20used%20as%20stated%20above) . (In later format revisions, some of these higher bits are used to indicate additional SID chips – see **Multi-SID Extensions** below – but those files still carry version 2 in the header and rely on the player to interpret the bits if it supports multi-SID.)
- **0x78: Start Page (BYTE)** – This field (also called *“relocStartPage”* ) helps in relocating the music driver in memory if necessary [[36]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B78%20%20%20%20BYTE,relocStartPage) . It indicates the beginning of the largest free memory block *within the C64 memory ranges used by the music driver* . The value is given as a high memory page number (0x00–0xFF, corresponding to addresses $0000, $0100, $0200, ... $FF00). For example, a value of 0x1E means the free block starts at $1E00 [[37]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=even%20a%20single%20free%20page%2C,memory%20range%20starts%20at%20%241E00) . Special cases: 0x00 means **the tune is “clean”** , not needing any relocation (it doesn’t write outside its own data area in memory) [[38]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20an%208%20bit,single%20largest%20free%20memory%20range) ; and 0xFF means **no free space available** (the music code uses all available driver memory, so relocation is impossible) [[38]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20an%208%20bit,single%20largest%20free%20memory%20range) . If startPage is 0 or 0xFF, no relocation should be attempted and the next field (pageLength) will be 0. This feature is primarily used when playing SID files on a real C64 alongside other software – it tells if and where you could load a custom player routine without corrupting the music. Most SID players on modern systems ignore these fields, but tools like SID relocators use them.
- **0x79: Page Length (BYTE)** – The length (in 256-byte pages) of the free memory region starting at startPage [[39]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B79%20%20%20%20BYTE,relocPages) . For example, if startPage = 0x1E and pageLength = 0x02, it means there is a contiguous free space covering 0x1E00–0x1FFF (two pages) available for use. If startPage is 0 or 0xFF (meaning no specific free area or no free space), then pageLength is set to 0 [[40]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20v2NG%20specific,field) . **Relocation constraints:** The free area defined by startPage/length should not overlap the memory where the SID data itself is loaded, and in RSID files it also must not overlap any ROM or I/O areas ($A000–$BFFF, $D000–$FFFF) or the zero-page/stack area ($0000–$03FF) [[41]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=If%20%27startPage%27%20is%20not%200,must%20be%20set%20to%200) . These rules ensure that if a tune is to be made runnable on a real C64, the relocated player code won’t corrupt essential memory or the music code itself.
- **0x7A: Reserved (WORD)** – 2 bytes reserved for future use [[42]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B7A%20%20%20%20WORD,reserved) . In the original PSID v2 spec, these are always 0 and have no effect. **(Multi-SID note:** In later extensions, these bytes are utilized to specify additional SID chip addresses for 2SID/3SID tunes – see below – but a standard v2 file will have them zeroed.)**

At offset **0x7C** , the header ends and the C64 program data begins [[43]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=This%20is%20a%2016%20bit,should%20be%20set%20to%200) [[44]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=%2B7C%20) . In a PSID v2 file (with only one SID chip), the bytes 0x7A and 0x7B are typically 0 and the version field is still 0x0002. Even if the flags and reserved bytes are all zero, players can distinguish a v2 header from v1 by the dataOffset field (0x7C vs 0x76) or the version word.

### Multi-SID Extensions (PSID v3 &amp; v4)

The SID format was later extended (without changing the fundamental header layout) to support tunes that use more than one SID chip for extra sound channels. These multi-chip tunes are commonly known as **2SID** (for two SID chips) or **3SID** (three chips). In the HVSC collection, such files use the same .sid extension but internally they employ the previously reserved bytes to specify additional SID chip addresses. They also set the header *version* to 3 or 4 to indicate the presence of extra SID(s) [[45]](https:/www.c64os.com/c64os/programmersguide/usinglibraries_sidplay#:~:text=.text%20,word%20%2400%20start%20song) [[46]](https:/www.hvsc.c64.org/faq#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20play%20_2SID,use%20a%20modified%20C64) . Here is how multi-SID is handled in the format:

- **Header version:** A file with **two SID chips** sets the version to 0x0003 (often referred to as PSID v3), and a file with **three SID chips** sets it to 0x0004 (PSID v4) [[45]](https:/www.c64os.com/c64os/programmersguide/usinglibraries_sidplay#:~:text=.text%20,word%20%2400%20start%20song) . Despite these version numbers, the header size remains the same as v2 (data still starts at 0x7C) [[47]](https:/www.c64os.com/c64os/programmersguide/usinglibraries_sidplay#:~:text=.text%20,word%20%2400%20start%20song) [[44]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=%2B7C%20) – the extra information is encoded in the formerly reserved bytes. Older players that do not recognize version 3/4 may refuse to play these files, but modern SID players interpret them properly. *(If a player only checks dataOffset and sees 0x7C, it might even play a 2SID as if it were a normal SID, but it would ignore the second chip – thus explicit versioning to 3/4 helps the player know it can expect multiple SID output.)*
- **0x7A: Second SID Address (BYTE)** – The address of the secondary SID chip, if present. In PSID v3 (or v4) files, this byte is non-zero to indicate an additional SID. The value represents the hardware address where the second SID is mapped in the C64’s memory-mapped I/O. It is encoded as the “middle byte” of the SID’s base address: for example, a value of 0x42 here corresponds to address **$D420** [[48]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20v3%20specific,should%20be%20set%20to%200) . Valid values range from $42 ($D420) up to $FE ($DFE0) in steps of 2, because SID chips are typically placed at addresses that are multiples of 0x20. Certain ranges are invalid: values below $42 (i.e. $D000–$D410 region) and $80–$DF ($D800–$DDF0 region) are not allowed [[49]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20v3%20specific,should%20be%20set%20to%200) (since $D000–$D3FF is standard C64 hardware and $D800–$DBFF is VIC-II memory, etc.). If this byte is 0 or an invalid value, it means no second SID is used [[49]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20v3%20specific,should%20be%20set%20to%200) . Common addresses for a second SID in hardware mods are $D420 or $D500; the field allows flexibility for different configurations.
- **0x7B: Third SID Address (BYTE)** – The address of a tertiary SID chip, if present (PSID v4 files). Encoded the same way as the second SID address: e.g. 0x42 means $D420, etc., with the same range restrictions [[50]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=%2B7B%20BYTE%20thirdSIDAddress) . This field is used only if a third SID is actually used (header version 4); if not used, it should be 0. It’s invalid for the third SID address to be the same as the second SID’s address (each extra SID must have a unique address) [[51]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=This%20is%20an%208%20bit,D410%29%20and) .
- **Flags bits for extra SID chips:** In PSID v3/v4, the previously reserved flag bits are utilized to specify the **SID model type of the additional chips** . Specifically, **bits 6–7** in the flags word indicate the model of the second SID, and **bits 8–9** indicate the model of the third SID [[52]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) [[53]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) . The coding for these bits is the same 2-bit code as for the primary SID (00=unknown, 01=6581, 10=8580, 11=6581+8580) [[52]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) [[53]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) . If the value is “00” (Unknown), it implies the additional SID is assumed to be the same type as the first SID chip [[54]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=If%20bits%206,model%20as%20the%20first%20SID) [[55]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=If%20bits%206,model%20as%20the%20first%20SID) . For example, a 2SID file might specify that the first SID is 6581 and the second is 8580 via these bits, or both the same, etc., allowing the player to emulate the proper combination of chips. Bits 10–15 remain reserved (0) even in v4 [[56]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=To%20ensure%20that%20music%20specifically,are%20used%20as%20stated%20above) .

Aside from the above, multi-SID files function like normal SID files – they have one init routine that typically initializes both chips, and a play routine that updates all SID registers. To actually produce sound from a 2SID or 3SID file, a player needs multiple SID emulators or hardware chips. If such a file is played on a single-SID setup, one of the channels (or two, in 3SID case) would be missing.

**Playing 2SID/3SID:** To handle these, the player should allocate additional SID chip instances at the specified addresses. For example, a 2SID tune might use $D400 for the first SID and $D420 for the second; the code will write to registers in both address ranges. The music data itself typically contains the logic to detect and use the extra SID(s) – the header just informs the player where to mirror the SID. In terms of file construction: for a 2SID/3SID file, the sid data payload contains all the code for both chips’ music, and it’s up to the code to output to the extra addresses. When creating a new SID file that uses multiple SIDs, one would set the version to 3 or 4, fill in the second/third SID address bytes, and use the flags bits to denote the chip models accordingly [[46]](https:/www.hvsc.c64.org/faq#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20play%20_2SID,use%20a%20modified%20C64) [[52]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20MOS6581%20and%20MOS8580) .

### Data Section (C64 Program Data)

The **data section** begins at the offset given by the *dataOffset* field (0x76 for v1, 0x7C for v2/v3/v4). This section contains the raw 6502 machine code and binary data that constitutes the music player and song data. Essentially, this is a C64 program that, when loaded at the specified address and executed, produces music on the SID chip [[1]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=The%20High%20Voltage%20SID%20collection,their%20offset%20from%20the%20start) .

If the **load address field** in the header was 0, the first two bytes of the data are the little-endian load address [[5]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B08%20%20%20%20WORD,loadAddress) . A SID player will typically do the following to play a tune:

1. Read the header to determine where to load the data and how to initialize/play it.
2. Load the data bytes into a C64 memory map at the appropriate address (either using the explicit loadAddress or the one in the data’s first two bytes) [[5]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=%2B08%20%20%20%20WORD,loadAddress) .
3. If it’s a PSID file (or an RSID without the BASIC flag), simulate a call to the **init address** routine. This involves setting the 6510 registers as needed (at least the A register to select the start song number) and jumping to the init address in the emulated C64. The init code will prepare the song (setup SID registers, timers, interrupts, etc.) [[4]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=%2B0A%2016,expected%20to%20double%20as%20init) [[14]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=%2B0C%2016,service%20handler%20itself%20during%20init) . If the BASIC flag is set (RSID), the player would instead simulate a BASIC RUN to start the program, since the initAddress is 0 in that case and the BASIC code will call the machine code.
4. To play the music, the SID player either:
5. If **playAddress != 0** (typical PSID case): call the play routine at roughly 50Hz/60Hz. The timing should respect the video standard flag and speed bits to decide if it uses a CIA timer or VBI timing for calls [[19]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=A%200%20bit%20specifies%20vertical,default%2060Hz) . This can be done by simply delaying the appropriate milliseconds between calls, or by cycle-accurate synchronization in an emulator.
6. If **playAddress = 0** (typical RSID case): do nothing extra, because the music code has installed an IRQ that calls itself every frame. In an emulator, the interrupts will automatically drive the music. In a hardware setup, once the code is running, the C64 itself plays the music until you stop it.

The code in the data section writes to the SID registers ($D400–$D418 for the first SID chip) to produce sound. **SID players** must emulate the SID chip’s audio output. On a real Commodore 64, this means the code runs on the 6510 CPU and the actual SID chip produces sound. In an emulator or SID player software, a 6510 CPU emulator executes the SID code, and a SID audio emulator generates the sound from the writes to SID registers [[57]](https:/chiptunesak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sid.html#:~:text=Commodore%20SID%20Music%20%E2%80%94%20ChiptuneSAK,%E2%80%9CReal%20SID%E2%80%9D) . The **SID file itself does not contain audio samples** , it contains instructions to generate audio. This is why a SID file is usually only a few kilobytes in size – it’s program code, not waveform data.

**RSID environment:** For RSID files (which require a real C64 environment), the player should emulate a “power-on” C64 state before init. For example, set the C64’s CIA and VIC registers to default values, ensure ROMs are in place, etc. RSID tunes often rely on the system initialization (like the CIA timers, or even the BASIC warm start) to function correctly [[58]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=but%20strictly%20require%20a%20real,if%20at%20all) [[59]](https:/gist.github.com/cbmeeks/2b107f0a8d36fc461ebb056e94b2f4d6#:~:text=Before%20the%20data%20of%20a,play%20the%20SID%20tune%20correctly) . According to the spec, an RSID tune is presented with a *default C64 power-on state* : interrupts off, CIA timer A running at 60Hz with interrupts enabled (for timing), the VIC-II not yet enabled for IRQ, the memory configuration in default ($37) state, etc. [[60]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20default%20C64%20environment%20is,as%20follows) [[61]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=VIC%20,%2437) . This is to force the music code to do its own setup. In contrast, a PSID tune is allowed to assume a simpler environment since it’s usually self-contained – many PSID tunes, for example, don’t worry about NTSC vs PAL differences or assume certain zero-page values because older players standardized those. With PSID v2NG and RSID, the goal was to move toward **cycle-accurate playback** and real-hardware compatibility, so these files encode all necessary info to achieve that [[62]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=All%20the%20above%20means%20that,SID%20emulators%20based%20on%20the) [[2]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=latest%20libsidplay2%20emulation%20engine%20,which%20allows%20for%20safe%20rejection) .

**SID chip model:** When playing or creating SID files, note the SID model flag (6581 vs 8580) in the header. This is not just informative; it should be heeded because the audio output can differ significantly. For example, 8580 SID requires a different method to play samples (the so-called Digi tunes) and has a “cleaner” filter. If a song was composed on a 6581, it might rely on the 6581’s filter quirk; playing it on an 8580 with the wrong filter settings would make it sound incorrect [[34]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=The%20MOS6581%20and%20the%20MOS8580,from%20the%20MOS6581%20analog%20filter) [[63]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=To%20ensure%20that%20music%20specifically,are%20used%20as%20stated%20above) . Therefore, a SID player should switch its SID emulation or hardware according to this field. When building a SID file, set this field appropriately to inform users and players of the intended chip. If a tune works on both, use the “11” both value. Similarly, use the PAL/NTSC flag to indicate the intended video timing so the tempo is correct on playback [[32]](https:/ocremix.org/info/SID_Format_Specification#:~:text=,11%20%3D%20PAL%20and%20NTSC) [[22]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,required%20to%20support%20a%20real) .

### Conclusion

Using the above specification, one can implement a SID file parser and even create SID files. **Parsing a SID file** involves reading the header fields to get the metadata (song name, author, etc.) and the playback parameters (init address, play address, number of songs, speed, flags for chip/clock) [[1]](https:/hackaday.io/project/182833-sidman-player/log/218940-sid-file-structure#:~:text=The%20High%20Voltage%20SID%20collection,their%20offset%20from%20the%20start) [[64]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,required%20to%20support%20a%20real) . This information can be displayed in an info panel and used to configure a SID emulator for playback. The **history and structure** provided also highlight why certain fields exist – for example, the PlaySID vs RSID distinction, or the addition of video standard and SID model to ensure the music sounds as intended on real hardware [[65]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=PSIDv2NG%20,C64%20compatible%20or%20specific%20to) [[26]](https:/commodorefree.com/magazine/vol1/commodore_free_issue_4.pdf#:~:text=,to%20play%20the%20SID%20tune) .

For **building a SID file** (i.e. composing or converting music into SID format), one would: prepare a 6502 machine code routine that plays the music, decide if it needs the C64 environment (if yes, it might be an RSID), decide on PAL or NTSC timing, and which SID chip(s) to target. Then create a header with the appropriate fields: set magicID to "PSID" or "RSID", choose the version (almost always 2 for new files; use 3 or 4 if multiple SID chips are used), fill in load address (or 0 to include it in data), set init and play addresses (or 0 as required), number of songs, etc., and especially set the **flags** : bit0 if the tune is a Compute! .MUS data (usually not), bit1 if the tune uses PlaySID-specific techniques (or in RSID, if it includes BASIC), bits2-3 for PAL/NTSC, bits4-5 for 6581/8580, and the relocation and extra SID fields if needed. By adhering to the spec, your SID files will be compatible with modern players and even real C64s (when appropriate). This detailed understanding also ensures a SID player you develop can handle the full range of SID files – from old PSID v1 tunes to sophisticated RSID v2NG and multi-SID tunes – without surprises. Happy SID hacking!
